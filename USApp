# User Story: Defining Tab Navigation for {Object} in Salesforce App

## Title  
As a Product Manager, I want clearly defined tabs for key objects like {Object1}, {Object2}, and {Object3} in the Salesforce app, so that users can navigate easily and focus on the most relevant sections of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The app displays navigation tabs for core objects such as {Object1}, {Object2}, and {Object3}.
- Each tab leads directly to the appropriate list view or detail page.
- Tabs are ordered based on usage priority, starting with the most accessed objects.
- The tab names are intuitive and follow the business language (e.g., “My Projects” instead of “Project__c”).
- Tabs only appear for users with the necessary permissions or profiles.
- The tab layout is mobile-responsive and works across all supported devices.

## Example Tab Configuration

### Tabs to Display:
- **Projects**: Displays a list view of all relevant project records.
- **Tasks**: Shows user-assigned and team tasks.
- **Resources**: Lists available team members and their roles.
- **Reports**: Opens dashboards or report summaries.

### Ordering Logic:
1. Projects (most accessed daily)
2. Tasks (frequent updates)
3. Resources (occasionally referenced)
4. Reports (on-demand insights)

### Visibility Rules:
- Show **Projects** and **Tasks** for all users.
- Show **Resources** only for **Managers**.
- Show **Reports** only for **Admins and Analysts**.

## Notes

- Tabs should reflect the most important user journeys and simplify access to day-to-day functions.
- Avoid cluttering the interface with rarely-used objects.
- Any new object added in the future must follow this tab configuration model and be reviewed for business relevance and access profiles.
