# User Story: Configuring List Views for {Object} in Salesforce App

## Title
As a Product Manager, I want to easily view, filter, and sort entries of {Object} in the Salesforce app, so that I can quickly access and manage relevant records based on key {Field1}, {Field2}, and other important criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The app provides a list view for {Object} that displays selected fields, such as {Field1}, {Field2}, {Field3}, and {Field4}.
- Users can filter {Object} records using key fields like {Field1} and {Field2}.
- The list view supports both sorting and searching by {Field1} or {Field2}.
- The list view allows for inline actions, such as editing or deleting a record.
- The list view is easily accessible from the main navigation or the {Object} tab.

## Example List View Configuration

- **Displayed Columns:**  
  - {Field1}
  - {Field2}
  - {Field3}
  - Last Modified Date

- **Filtering Options:**  
  - Filter by {Field1} (multi-select)
  - Filter by {Field2}
  - Search by {Field1} or {Field3}

- **Sorting:**  
  - Default sort by Last Modified Date
  - Allow sorting by {Field1} or {Field2}

- **Quick Actions:**  
  - Edit
  - Delete
  - View Details

---

## Notes

- The list view should be optimized for Product Managers and non-technical users.
- Only fields relevant to decision-making should be visible by default; technical or system fields should be hidden.
- The configuration can be adapted for any {Object} in the application, following this template.
